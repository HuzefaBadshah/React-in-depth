# Redux Toolkit
- Install @reduxjs/toolki and react-redux
- Build your own store
- Connect the store to our application
- Slice (cart slice)
- dispatch(action)
- Selector


# Performance

- Subscribe to the specific portion of the store, coz we don't want whole store but only a specific slice to be subscribed.

# Important Note about Reducers

- Slice can have multiple reducers, therefore property name is reducers
- Store will have one reducer, therefore property name is reducer

Redux toolkit uses Immer to mutate state behind the scenes
